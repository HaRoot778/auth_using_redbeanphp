Other notes:
	I switched server from xamp to openserver, because xamp doesnt support sending emails. I did it via smtp of openserver. 
	I changed the password of webhost (you can find it in db.php file), and droped the table (idk why, sometimes it does not work correctly).
	Now sending emails work correctly both localhost and webserver(000webhost).
	This version (16.10.2021) works stable on webserver and localhost, so I name it 1.0 .
	I need to work on design and some features, but now it works stable.
